# Optimistic Virtual Machine
`ovm` is an implementation of the standard `StateMachine` interface defined in `core`. It provides the ability to apply transactions & exposes endpoints required for common Optimistic Rollup implementations and other L2s.

### Requirements, Setup, & Testing
[View instructions here]('../../README.md').

### Deploying
TODO: You can deploy by running:

```sh
yarn run deploy:<contract-specific-task-here> <environment>
```

The `environment` parameter tells the deployment script which config file to use (expected filename `.<environment>.env`).
