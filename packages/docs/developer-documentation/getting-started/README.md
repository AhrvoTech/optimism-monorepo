# Getting Started

If you're looking to integrate with the OVM, welcome! You've come to the right place. Please note that the OVM is still in Alpha, and integrating now will inevitably uncover bugs. If you do, feel free to reach out to our [discord](https://discord.gg/cf4AErQ) or create a Github issue. We love talking to early adopters--don't be a stranger!

To get you up to speed, you can follow along with our ERC20 conversion tutorial which takes a simple ERC20 EVM contract, and shows you how to transpile and run tests through the OVM. After that you will find some general notes on the current status of the OVM and helpful debugging tips.
