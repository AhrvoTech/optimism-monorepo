## FAQ

### What is Optimistic Rollup?

A layer 2 scaling solution that allows you to run fully general solidity smart contracts. Powered by the OVM.

### What are the UX benefits of Optimistic rollup?

Instant transactions  
Native meta-transactions  
Native account abstraction  
No gas

### How does OVM compare to other scaling solutions?

No moon math. \(SNARKS, STARKS, etc.\)  
Not a sidechain. \(Data availability on ETH 1.0\)  
Smart contracts \(Generalized, interoperable\)  
Simple infrastructure. \(No consensus\)

### How many transactions per second?

ETH 1.0 \(today\): ~200 tps  
ETH 1.0 \(optimized\): ~2,000 tps  
ETH 2.0 \(sharded\): 2,000 \* \# of shards

### Is Optimistic Rollup secure?

Yes. Data availability on mainnet Ethereum guarantees anyone can challenge invalid transactions.

### What‚Äôs missing from this demo?

Layer 2 deposits and withdrawls. Instead, we airdrop testnet tokens to your wallet.

### How do I build a dApp on Optimistic rollup?

Check out the docs and code on Github. A lot of awesome functionality is still under development. If you‚Äôre looking for ways to scale your project, you can contact Plasma Group to request a consultation.
